    <h2>Coding, Simulating, and Visualizing Newton-Raphson Method</h2>

    <h3>Ben Hoffman – 11/15/2023</h4>

        <h4>Overview:</h4>
        <p>I intend to code an algorithm that uses the Newton-Raphson method to calculate the roots of a function. I’d
            also like to include a visual component that opens a window in which the program graphs the function and the
            tangent lines which are used to approximate the root. </p>
        
        <h4>Method:</h4>
        <p>The Newton-Raphson method is defined on </span><a

        <p>“a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a
            real-valued function. The most basic version starts with a real-valued function f, its derivative f′, and an
            initial guess x0 for a root of f. If f satisfies certain assumptions and the initial guess is close, then:
            x_1 = x_0 - f(x_0)/f’(x_0)</p>

        <h4>How I’ll do it: </h4>
        <p>This will likely be done with mostly Python in Pycharm or Google Collab (if the program ends up being
            computationally light.) I plan to do the computation with SymPy, as I have practice with it from the
            Explorations. The graphical part will likely also be with Sympy, but MatPlotLib is my backup, thanks to my
            brief experience with it in Scientific Computing. </p>
